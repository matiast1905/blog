In this case, I would like to get a coefficient that explains $$\\%affected \\sim GDPpercapita$$ for each death cause, that's why I will fit one model per death cause.\n\nThis is easy to do with the `{purrr}` package, which let us implement *functional programming* concepts within the *tidyverse*. To read more about this topic, [here are the vignettes](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) of the package. Also, in the *R for Data Science* book you can find a chapter dedicated to fitting [many models](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html) explaining these concepts.\n\nBefore creating our models, I will check the distribution of our predictor\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmortality_by_country_wdi %>% \n  filter(death_cause == \"Cardiovascular diseases\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(gdp_pcap)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +\n  labs(x = \"GDP per capita in current US$ (log-scale)\",\n       title = \"Distribution of GDP per capita\") +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(family = \"Tabular\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 20),\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){fig-align='center' width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that GDP per capita has an approximate log-normal distribution, so I will apply a transformation (log2) to the predictor before fitting the model\n\nWhat about the response variable?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmortality_by_country_wdi %>%\n  filter(year == max(year),\n         fct_lump(death_cause, 12, w = percent_affected) != \"Other\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(percent_affected)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap(~ death_cause, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  labs(x = \"% of deaths (log-scale)\",\n       title = \"Distribution of % of deaths by cause\") +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(family = \"Tabular\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 20),\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){fig-align='center' width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe response variable also look log-normal distributed.\n\nIf we want to create linear models to predict: $$log(\\% affected) \\sim \\beta_0 + \\beta_1log(GDPpercapita) + \\epsilon$$ It can be done with the `lm()` function. The problem with having both variables (dependent and independent) transformed by the `log` function is that it would be harder to interpret the coefficients ($\\beta_1$) of the model. That's why I will start by fitting a simpler model of the form: $$\\% affected \\sim \\beta_0 + \\beta_1log(GDPpercapita) + \\epsilon$$ In this case, our dependent variable is a percentage, that means that it can take values in the range $[0, 1]$. For this reason, a *beta regression* could be a good alternative to the *linear regression*. The advantage of the *beta regression* is that the output will always be in the mentioned range. The disadvantage is that it applies a transformation to the output (the *logit* function), and again, as with the *log* transformation, it would be harder to interpret the coefficients of the model.

Countries with higher incomes are more likely to have people dying of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and alzheimer's disease, all these being [noncommunicable diseases](https://www.who.int/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases#tab=tab_1).\n\nOn the other hand, in countries with low income, you are more likely to die of tuberculosis, malaria, diarrheal diseases, enteric infections and neonatal disorders, all these are diseases that have treatment and in most cases could be avoided with a better hygiene and access to clean water, that's why the probability of dying for this causes in higher income countries is almost zero.\n\nSo, the conclusion we drawn from the analysis is that money produces cancer? That doesn't sound right... It's important to highlight that age of death was never considered in this analysis, and a more reasonable hypothesis would be that people dying of cancer live longer than those dying of neonatal disorder. In this case, a more accurate conclusion might be: *money allows you to live enough to die of cancer*.\n\nNow we know what produced deaths around the world in 2019, another interesting question is: Have the death causes proportions been changing over the years within country?

There is a great tool that can help us in this case: [principal component analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). From Wikipedia:\n\n> Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. Formally, PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where (most of) the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points.\n\nThe PCA could be done using the `prcomp` function from the `{stats}` package. Here is the implementation\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(countrycode)\n\nmortality_pca <-\n  mortality_by_country %>%\n  filter(year == max(year)) %>% \n  select(-year, -country) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = death_cause, values_from = percent_affected) %>%\n  janitor::clean_names() %>%\n  column_to_rownames(\"country_code\") %>%\n  prcomp(scale. = TRUE)\n\nbroom::tidy(mortality_pca, \"d\") %>%\n  filter(cumulative < 0.9) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = PC)) +\n  geom_col(aes(y = percent)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = cumulative)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = cumulative)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = 1:13,\n    limits = c(0.5, 13.5),\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  geom_text(aes(\n    y = percent,\n    label = scales::percent(percent, accuracy = .01)\n  ), nudge_y = 0.02, family = \"Tabular\") +\n  labs(title = \"What percentage of variation in the data is explained by each principal component?\",\n       y = NULL,\n       x = \"Principal component\",\n       subtitle = \"Only the first 13 components plotted, which account for 90% of the variance in the data\") +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(family = \"Tabular\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){fig-align='center' width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe first 2 components almost explain 50% of the variance in the data, this means that we can replace the original 32 columns with only 2, and still explain 50% of the variability of the data.

From Wikipedia:\n\n> Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem.\n\nIn summary, clustering consists on finding groups in the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmortality_kmeans <- \n  mortality_by_country %>%\n  filter(year == max(year)) %>% \n  select(-year, -country) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = death_cause, values_from = percent_affected) %>%\n  janitor::clean_names() %>%\n  column_to_rownames(\"country_code\")\n\nmortality_scaled <- \n  mortality_kmeans %>% \n  scale()\n\nfactoextra::fviz_nbclust(mortality_scaled, kmeans, method = \"wss\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"Roboto Condensed\",\n                base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(family = \"Tabular\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){fig-align='center' width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith the help of the `{factoextra}` package we can easily plot total within sum of square vs the number of clusters.

In this case, a value of $k$ in the range $[2,4]$ looks reasonable, I will choose $k = 3$.\n\nNow we need to select which algorithm we want to use.

It means that even though nowadays we have a noticeable difference in causes of deaths around the world, the trend is positive.

I try to use different tools and methods through all the exploration. Although I didn't explain the code, the idea of the post is that you can see the implementation of the tools in a context of an exploratory data analysis, copy the code that you find useful, and use it in your own analysis.\n\nAs a conclusion, the main insights extracted from the data are:\n\n1.    **Cardiovascular diseases** account for almost a third of the global deaths.\n2.    **Noncommunicable diseases** account for 74% of the global deaths.\n3.    People who live in countries with higher GDP per capita are more likely to die of Cardiovascular diseases, Cancers and alzheimer's disease, and less likely to die of tuberculosis, malaria, enteric infections and many other communicable diseases.\n4.    Lastly, the most important, **global trends are changing over time**. Global health is getting better over the years, hopefully there will be a time when all the death causes that were eradicated in high income countries will also cease to exist in lower income countries.\n",
